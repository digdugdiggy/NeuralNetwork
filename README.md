# Neural Networking

A simple project to understand the basics of Neural Networks. It creates a simple 2 input, 1 output neural network to 
replicate a logic AND gate.

Firstly, a Topology is defined, which defines how many neural nodes are in each layer of the net. This project defines a three 
level network: 2 Input nodes, 4 internal nodes, and 1 output node.

Next, I generate 2000 examples of an AND gate functioning correctly. I then feed these to the neural net, making it guess at a 
correct response, before showing it the correct results.

After the initial training phase, the neural net has learned the intended behavior and functions like an AND gate.

This same node-based neural network can be applied to many other topics, and is of great interest to me.
